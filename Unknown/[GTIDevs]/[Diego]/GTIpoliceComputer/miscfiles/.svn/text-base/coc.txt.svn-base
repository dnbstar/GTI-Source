1. Act exemplary. You have a job that involves integrity and politeness. Show these values to everybody whenever you're clocked in.
2. Any overrides with the law enforcement rules result in the strictest rule being applied.
3. You mustn't use your nightstick and other utilities to troll or annoy anybody around.
4. You must drive carefully, as long as the situation allows you to. Tun sirens on when it's needed.
5. Threatening, blackmailing, trolling, annoying, ... are all objectionable as an officer. Remain calm and professional at any time.
6. You must not be a part of the law enforcement to make cash easily. You do this job because you care.
7. Your collegues must be your best friends. Do not irritate your collegues for any reason. Also, officers of other agencies are not necessarily lower or higher ranked than you.
8. Realize that excuses like nescience can't be used to report an invalid punishment. All officers must know all rules.
